I was no exception.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I started my work on the HackerOne platform at the end of the October 2016. Actually, I registered there in the May 2016, but was busy with startup and forgot about it (I worked as PHP Developer in that time).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can\u2019t say that I was completely new in infosec\u200a\u2014\u200aI had some experience as Backend Web Developer, and as Hacker Newbie (in the old times, when I was studying at the University, I hacked some amount of online games). But I have no idea about basics\u200a\u2014\u200abugs types, classification, exploitation, responsible disclosure, etc. I think I was familiar only with request interception, and XSS\/SQLi in that time, because as webdev I had tasks about sanitization\/neutralization of malicious user\u2019s input.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I started in October 2016, I was excited by HackerOne platform. Big count of public programs, friendly interface and usability, great markdown, strict reputation system and awesome hacktivity timeline\u200a\u2014\u200aI liked all these features. I chose the random public program, and wrote my first report, included 3(!) POC tools, written on C#, and immediately got N\/A. Reason? I didn\u2019t read the policy, and submitted the outscope bug (credentials brutforce).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*KMZJXkuFA9sBMorypUqrVw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"330\" height=\"361\" data-image-id=\"1*KMZJXkuFA9sBMorypUqrVw.png\" data-width=\"330\" data-height=\"361\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -20px; text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Me, when I got my first\u00a0N\/A<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, I submitted more bugs\u2026And more\u2026And even not security bugs\u2026When my signal was less than -1, I started to think that I\u2019m doing something wrong. And the answer was simple\u200a\u2014\u200aI wanted the bounties too much. Then I told myself\u200a\u2014\u200astop, I\u2019m not ready yet, I need some practice and learning, and realizing, what is really important for me in this area.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are a 5 simple rules, from my own experience, which helped me. Following them, In 1 year\u00a0 I jumped from the almost -2 signal, and 95 rep to the 6+ Signal, and 3k+ rep:<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Rule #1. Patience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*sVqFfLAQ0xR1q50X3_w_gA.png\" alt=\"If you use H1 platform and have this badge, you know what i\u2019m talking\u00a0about\" width=\"231\" height=\"245\" data-image-id=\"1*sVqFfLAQ0xR1q50X3_w_gA.png\" data-width=\"231\" data-height=\"245\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -20px; text-align: center;\"><em style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If you use H1 platform and have this badge, you know what I\u2019m talking\u00a0about<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you interested in the bug bounties, such ability as patience is a great thing. If you can\u2019t sleep, thinking about your opened report, you definitely should upgrade this awesome skill. Every security team has different handling of the security reports, and such thing, like, for example, continuous asking for the updates every 2\u20133 days can cause even greater delay.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*Cn-Vz6irn7ZNVNWMYlTpXA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*Cn-Vz6irn7ZNVNWMYlTpXA.png\" data-width=\"251\" data-height=\"110\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -20px; text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Patience does not mean inactivity<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Rule #2. Continuous learning.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Insanity\u200a\u2014\u200ait is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you not have good results in the bug bounty, the faster you understand, identify and accept your weaknesses\u200a\u2014\u200athe faster success will come to you. Worse, if you report all the things, as I did, without reading the policy, hoping for the bounties. As the companies implement continuous security,\u00a0 security researcher must continuously keep up and improve the knowledge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Rule #3. Understanding that security is more important than the bug bounty money.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bounties are the great motivation, but your success as security researcher is more important, if you really like this work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Rule #4. Be unique. Use improved tools. Develop your own bugs discovery techniques.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learn from others, but do not copypaste others. When using the public tools, try to improve them, add something unique stuff. Using Sublist3r? Make it more speedy &amp; add new discovery techniques! It will bring you more bugs &amp; less duplicates. Writing your own tools is a big advantage too &#8211; you can develop exactly what u need!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rule #1337. Report quality. Please, do not assign improper severity for your bugs. Marking Text Injection or SSL Poodle on the static site as Critical is a bad idea, and it&#8217;s making infosec community cry.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And, some programs reward an extra bonuses for good and well-written reports!<\/p>\n<p>P.S.
